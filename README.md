# DIM Wishlists

These are groupings of wishlists depending on what I'm looking for. You're tastes may be different, and that's alright. I'm doing my best to group these together appropriately to help you decide. Feel free to download any of these files or submit an issue to convince me why I should change a roll in my lists.

## General Wishlist

Wishlists that will help you find the guns that have the best perks for your style of gameplay.

All weapon wishlists a compiled to a single file, [wishlists/general.txt](https://github.com/joshminnie/DIMWishlists/blob/master/wishlists/general.txt), for your convenience.

## Raid Wishlists

Wishlists that will help you find guns that are recommended for the raids based on the current metas.

All raid wishlists are compiled to a single file, [wishlists/raids.txt](https://github.com/joshminnie/DIMWishlists/blob/master/wishlists/raids.txt), for your convenience.
