# DIM Wishlists

These are groupings of wishlists depending on what I'm looking for. You're tastes may be different, and that's alright. I'm doing my best to group these together appropriately to help you decide. Feel free to download any of these files or submit an issue to convince me why I should change a roll in my lists.
